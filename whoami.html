                        <p>There's nothing better than dedicate time to yourself, in order to improve more and more. I currently train 5 times a week, as I believe that each muscle area requires particular attention.</p>
                        <p>Nowadays people think that take care of ourself, in particular physically, is useless, but honesly I believe that every body speaks for itself and, consequently, allows you to partially know the person concerned.</p>

                        <p>My story with coding is a little bit complicated!</p>
                        <p>Back in the days, when I had to choose where I should have gone to study, my first thought was to learn ICT because I was really fascinated by it. 
                            During my five years I started to hate it so when I finally finished the school I decided to study something complitely different, such as Economics. 
                            It tooks me only 2 months to understand that I had strongly gone through the wrong way, so I retraced my steps, I temporarily dropped out of school and found a course that could really teach me how to program: as already mentioned Start2Impact.</p>
                        <p>I've always believed that 
                            <span>work must be something continuously fascinating and stimulating</span>, because otherwise it is no longer an opportunity, but a condemnation.</p>
